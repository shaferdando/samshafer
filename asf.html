    	Shafer Dando was born on July 3, 2007, in Berkeley California. He grew up moving all around the world, some of the places where he lived were Oakland, Australia, South Carolina, Georgia, San Diego, and Piedmont. With all of the places he has lived, he has met a lot of people and gained much more life experience than if he lived in the same spot the whole time. Shafer isnâ€™t sure what place was his favorite to live as they have all given him different experiences, friends, and memories. Although he said his top 3 places where he lived are Piedmont, San Diego, and South Carolina. Shafer has now lived in Piedmont, CA for 4 years.
